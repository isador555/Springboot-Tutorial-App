"# Springboot-Tutorial-App" 

Hello!
This simple app was made by using the Springboot tutorial found here: https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/

To run the app, open the command prompt and in the root directory run "gradlew build && java -jar build/libs/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar". The app will then run on localhost:8080.
